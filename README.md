# NBA-Prime
## Overview
* Building a data-driven model to find an NBA player's "prime"
* To create the ultimate system for power ranking the NBA's greatest players (e.g. Why is player X the 27th best player of all time, and player Y the 28th? What separates the two?)
* Sponsored by and providing model results and insights for the [Hard in the Paint NBA Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/engineers-play "Hard in the Paint NBA Podcast")
